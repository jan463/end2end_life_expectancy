# Life Expectancy around the World

This project involves a short exploratory data analysis (EDA) on life expectancy data. The goal is to uncover patterns and gain insights 
using SQL and Python for data analysis.  

### Introduction
Understanding life expectancy trends can help in assessing the health and development status of different countries. 
This project analyzes various factors affecting life expectancy through EDA.  

### Dataset
[Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasg23/life-expectancy-averaged-dataset)  

Description: The dataset contains multiple records, including features such as country, year, and factors related to health and socio-economic status.  

### Technologies
SQL: Used for data querying.
Python: Used for additional data analysis and visualization.  

### Analysis
The analysis explores:
- Correlation between life expectancy and socio-economic indicators like GDP, vaccination rates, etc.
- Comparisons across different countries or regions.
- Effect of schooling

### Conclusion
📈 Higher GDP per capita often correlates with increased life expectancy.  
🫄🏼 Higher GDP countries tend to have higher average BMI.  
👩🏼‍🎓 Longer schooling duration often correlates with higher GDP.
